EVA 5 Assignment 4:

### Experiment:

#### Dataset : MNIST

To acheive validation accuracy of 99.49 I have used a expand and shrink network with kernel size 3*3 16 channels with batch normalization and image normalization, I had used drop out but I was able to achieve higher accuracy without dropout may be the reason is layer depth. 

### Summary:
A network was modelled and trained and an accuracy of 99.49% was achieved in 20 epochs. The network was designed with the constranints mentioned below:

* 99.4% validation accuracy
* Less than 20k Parameters
* You can use anything from above you want.
* Less than 20 Epochs
* No fully connected layer

#### Result:

* 99.49% validation accuracy
* Paramteres : 19128
* Epochs : 20
